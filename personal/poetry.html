      <b>Shapes</b>
      <div>I saw a face but I saw no features <br>
my humanity doesn't belong to me<br>
I saw beings but they were only creatures<br>
what is it supposed to seem?<br><br>

I've lost too much<br>
the concept of me begins to grey<br>
in the arms of consciousness<br>
shapes take over,<br>
a casting call<br>

is the awareness of my oblivion enough<br>
memories just extensions of my thoughts<br>
am I peering into a prism as it looks down on me<br><br>

is my perspective just an outline of my mind<br>
edges still sharpen, but the points are misaligned<br>
have I let go of my human identity, or has it let go of me<br><br>

shapes begin to blur<br>
layers overlap, a shade muddier<br>
my ego begins to slur<br>
as I am, I deplete<br>
if I am, then I bleed<br>
into a pool, I am still<br>
from an ending comes beginnings human essence of me spills<br><br>

how I define myself escapes,<br>
the bounds of my universe deflate<br>
as I shuffle off this mortal coil<br>
I mouthe out my final form<br><br><br><br>

<b>A bird's end</b>
<div>
as I trudge the test of winter,<br>
through the beguiling blizzard, <br>
I am taken by a flurry of thoughts;<br>
in the confusion I fall, and my gaze follows<br><br>

suddenly, a sight makes itself known:<br><br>

a bird, solemnly, <br>
lying dead on the snow<br><br>

its head is tucked,<br>
its wings are closed<br><br>

a bird’s lifeless body,<br>
consumed by the cold<br><br>

for this bird it will be forever,<br>
forever before the springtime comes<br><br>

a once lively singsong, inevitably, will decompose<br><br>

in the immensity of the moment, I realize:<br>
memories die too—<br>
as do notes,<br>
as does everything I’ve come to know <br><br>

the end comes to collect what I owe;<br>
the gift of life is something I borrow<br><br>

the end is certain;<br>
nothing preserves <br><br>

I close my eyes,<br>
and I begin to breathe.<br><br>
