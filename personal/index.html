      <b>shapes</b>
      <div>I saw a face but I saw no features <br>
my humanity doesn't belong to me<br>
I saw beings but they were only creatures<br>
what is it supposed to seem?<br><br>

I've lost too much<br>
the concept of me begins to grey<br>
in the arms of consciousness<br>
shapes take over,<br>
a casting call<br>

is the awareness of my oblivion enough<br>
memories just extensions of my thoughts<br>
am I peering into a prism as it looks down on me<br><br>

is my perspective just an outline of my mind<br>
edges still sharpen, but the points are misaligned<br>
have I let go of my human identity, or has it let go of me<br><br>

shapes begin to blur<br>
layers overlap, a shade muddier<br>
my ego begins to slur<br>
as I am, I deplete<br>
if I am, then I bleed<br>
into a pool, I am still<br>
from an ending comes beginnings human essence of me spills<br><br>

how I define myself escapes,<br>
the bounds of my universe deflate<br>
as I shuffle off this mortal coil<br>
I mouthe out my final form<br><br><br><br>

<b>a bird's end</b>
<div>
as I trudge the test of winter,<br>
through the beguiling blizzard, <br>
I am taken by a flurry of thoughts;<br>
in the confusion I fall, and my gaze follows<br><br>

suddenly, a sight makes itself known:<br><br>

a bird, solemnly, <br>
lying dead on the snow<br><br>

its head is tucked,<br>
its wings are closed<br><br>

a bird’s lifeless body,<br>
consumed by the cold<br><br>

for this bird it will be forever,<br>
forever before the springtime comes<br><br>

a once lively singsong, inevitably, will decompose<br><br>

in the immensity of the moment, I realize:<br>
memories die too—<br>
as do notes,<br>
as does everything I’ve come to know <br><br>

the end comes to collect what I owe;<br>
the gift of life is something I borrow<br><br>

the end is certain;<br>
nothing preserves <br><br>

I close my eyes,<br>
and I begin to breathe.<br><br><br><br>

<b>spell me out</b>
<div>
  spell me out<br>
  character by character<br>
  when I'm laid out on paper<br>
  I am known much better<br><br>

  take a layer off<br>
  and let yourself in<br>
  a closed book can't be empty<br>
  there must be something forgetting<br><br>

  column by column<br>
  row by row<br>
  each letter is mapped<br>
  straight through the soul<br><br>

  read between the lines<br>
  where the words aren't straight<br>
  I'm a heap of snapped intentions<br>
  a story best left unread<br>


  I'm falling apart and I'm inviting you<br>
  everything I have is everything I say<br>
  where words I don't know are mine,<br>
  keep finding a place<br><br>


  I'm confusing lines and I'm approaching you<br>
  with everything to hide, everything is true<br>
  where the story I don't know is mine<br>
  keeps finding a way<br><br>


  I don't know the ways I'm finding<br>
  new ways to show<br>
  that for any way you take me<br>
  my meaning is still hollow<br><br>


  write me off as unbidden<br>
  when my phrases grow twisted<br>
  sign me off halfway, knowing<br>
  not every happy ending is meant to be known<br><br><br><br>

<b>bones</b>
<div>
in my bones I had a feeling<br>
that under that vast, endless night<br>
there existed a meaning <br><br>

bearing my bones, I was human<br>
straight edged and rigid <br>
structured in billions of years of evolution <br><br>


there was a soft paradox at the window <br>
making scary faces <br>
as a simulacrum of my mind,<br>
a spur of dark energy became mine<br><br>


time stopped for a moment <br>
my heart had skipped a beat <br>
and I felt it rattling my bones <br>
in the spirit of deceit <br>
I had it wrong, or rather,<br>
wrong had me <br>
I was caught in a rift <br>
I was left to be<br><br>


this time was different <br>
I would not fall apart<br>
this time was melting<br>
into a distortion of I <br>
where my bones would bend<br>
but never quite snap<br>
where I was choked for air <br>
but unable to drown <br><br>


time stopped for a moment <br>
my heart had skipped a beat <br>
and I felt it rattling my bones <br>
in the spirit of deceit <br><br>

I had it wrong, or rather,<br>
wrong had me <br>
I was caught in a rift <br>
I was left to be<br><br>

this time, I was truly alone<br><br><br>
