    Hello! 
    My name is Jordan and I'm looking to form a band in SF to gig with, hopefully eventually writing our own songs. I moved here from Toronto this year after graduating. I used to gig and write music there with my previous band. Here's a video of us playing an <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4w2kIZp8lDlRbYQV0QGeIh?si=Z0M9U7K6T7-BcjYT7rL-4g">EP we wrote</a>
    (I'm the bassist)!

    I'm mainly a bassist but I enjoy guitar and vocals as well. I love writing lyrics. I have a good amount of experience in songwriting. I also have a lot of room for improvement.
    <p>Here is a <a href="influences.html">list of my main influences</a> in case that interests you. I'm not of course expecting to find bandmates who have the exact same taste as me, but I am looking for people who enjoy the same aspects of playing and writing that I do:</p>

    Like the melancholic contrast between dreamy vocals and heavily effected guitar in this song. Where the guitarist is smacking their guitar with a drumstick to create the best tone, where the vocalist sounds resigned after a big release. At the risk of sounding pretentious, I love this sort of storytelling through tone.

    Passionate playing, with harsh vocals and instrumentation. From beneath the noise, a beautiful melody emerges.

    If any of this sounds interesting to you, even if you're very new to playing (or even don't know how to play), please reach out! As long as the passion is there, I think there is lots of fun to be had.
